# Project Analysis Prompt

I need to create an AWS architecture diagram for this Terraform project. Can you:

1. **Analyze the Terraform configuration files**
   - Examine main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf
   - Review all modules in the modules/ directory
   - Check environment configurations in environments/
   - Identify backend configurations

2. **Identify all AWS services being used**
   - List each AWS resource type
   - Note any data sources
   - Identify provider configurations

3. **Map out the relationships between services**
   - Resource dependencies
   - Data flow patterns
   - Inter-service communication

4. **List the environments configured**
   - Development, staging, production
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Backend state management

Please provide:
- Complete list of AWS services used
- Service relationship mappings
- Environment configuration summary
- Any special considerations for the architecture

Focus on understanding the complete infrastructure setup and data flows.
