I need to create a professional AWS architecture diagram from my Terraform project. Please follow this workflow:

## Phase 1: Analysis
1. Examine all Terraform files (main.tf, modules/, environments/)
2. Identify AWS services, their relationships, and data flows
3. Detect multi-environment setup (target: prod)

## Phase 2: Asset Integration  
1. Use the AWS asset package at: '/Users/johxan/.aws-architecture-icons'
2. Find the 64px SVG icons for each identified service
3. Extract SVG content for embedding

## Phase 3: Diagram Creation
1. Create a professional SVG diagram (1400x900)
2. Use official AWS icons with 0.7 scale factor
3. Position icons at top-center of service boxes
4. Place service labels below icons
5. Add data flow arrows with labels
6. Include environment badges
7. Use official AWS colors and styling

## Requirements:
- Professional appearance matching AWS standards
- Clear service relationships and data flows
- Proper icon positioning and text alignment  
- No overlapping elements
- Consistent spacing throughout
- Save the final diagram as: /Users/johxan/Documents/my-projects/terraform/aws-hosting-synepho/architecture-diagram.svg

Generate a complete, production-ready architecture diagram.
